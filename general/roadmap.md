# Roadmap

source{d} is building the technology stack for machine learning on source code (MLonCode).
We allow code to become a first-class analyzable asset across tens of millions of repositories as well as a single one through our powerful source{d} Engine and machine learning tools.

With access to every open source and public git repository online today, developers and organizations can understand their code as part of the complex set of dependencies it really is. We envision every organization running a data pipeline over their software development life cycle, where source code becomes a unique, actionable dataset that can be analyzed and used in machine learning models.

These are the building blocks for the next generation of new and impactful developer tools & systems that will change the way we learn programming as well as how we write & review code.
