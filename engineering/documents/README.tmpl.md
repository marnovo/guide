# Project Name

```
Short description of the project.

Should mention the kind of project this is (library, demo, tool, etc.) and
the current [stability status](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stability-badges).

Consider adding screencasts or screenshots when they help understand the project.
GIFs can give a very good in-place representation of the tool in action.
See [sqle/gitquet](https://github.com/sqle/gitquery) for an example.
```

# Installation

```
Short installation guide or link to longer installation instructions.
This should include a pre-requisites subsection if needed.

Are there Docker images, packages managers (brew, apt, etc), installations scripts?
```

# Example of utilization

```
Basic example or link to an `examples` directory with its own `README.md`.
For libraries it might be some code.
For tools it might be a quickstart.
For demos it should explain how to run the demo.

For libraries, the examples should be as close as possible to the code
the user will eventually write.
For instance, when writing Go examples, you should write the code so the
import path appears in the code and any identifier used is qualified
with the package name.
