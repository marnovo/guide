# Donut

One potential downside of being a remote company is that sourcerers don't have as many opportunities to have sporadic, informal conversations to get to know each other better.

In order to solve this partially, we use [Donut for Slack](https://www.donut.ai/pairing). Donut is a Slack app that will match you up with someone from the company every two weeks to have a videocall or to meet in the Kitchen of the Madrid or SF office. This provides the opportunity for people to get to know each other better.

All you have to do to opt-in is join the `#sourcerers-matchup` channel and you will get an invite for every Monday at 10:00AM. It's the perfect time to also talk about the weekend ;)
