# Flexible Holidays, Working Schedule and Remote Work

At source{d} we believe in freedom and treating everyone as adults. If you're committed to what we can achieve together and love your job you don't need anyone forcing you to work in one certain way or another.

### Working Remotely

source{d} is fully remote friendly. What this means is that you can choose to be full-time remote from the Faroe Islands or work from the Madrid or San Francisco office but spend mornings/afternoons/several days remote. We believe people should work from where they feel most comfortable. 

If you want to know more about remote work practices at source{d}, check our [Company Wide Remote Guidelines](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/remote/remote_guidelines.md).

### Holiday Policy

Since we are a remote company, we want everyone to have the same amount of holidays, regardless of where they are working from. For this reason, you will have 23 days of holidays to use however you wish. Regarding bank holidays, you can structure how you use them as you like. At the beginning of every year we will let you know how many bank holidays there will be on Spain in that year and you will be able to use them however you wish. This means that you can make them coincide with bank holidays in your country of residence, or work on those national bank holidays and use them otherwise. If you live in a country with more bank holidays than Spain, you will have to notify our Office Manager so she can add those to your balance.

National festive days of the year will be established by the government, regional festivities will be established by the community of Madrid, and local festive days established by the City of Madrid. The calendar will be shared with you before the start of the year. 

For organizational purposes, you should let your manager know whenever you will take a day off, regardless of it being a bank holiday in your country or state of residence or not.

Unlike in some other companies we don't count the weekends of bank holidays that fall inside of your holidays. This means that if you take two weeks off it will count as 10 holidays (2x Monday-Friday). This is the norm in most countries but some companies in some countries also count the weekend in between as part of your holidays.

You can also work during weekends and exchange those days for additional holidays. You just have to let your team know that you are going to do so. Again, try to do it ahead of time so that everyone can plan accordingly.The company will include an extra day of vacations in the annual total amount.

If by the companyâ€™s necessities you have to work during a festive day or a weekend, you will receive an extra day of vacations to the day of work resulting in the addition of two vacation days added to the total annual amount of holidays. 

Finally, if you don't use all your days in one year, any unused days will carry over to the next.

### Working Schedule

This is very simple, there is none. You can come and go as you please as long as you get your work done and don't miss any of your meetings. Once you're here you'll see that some people come in very early and others very late, some leave early and others leave late. Everyone needs to be responsible enough to manage their own time and schedule.
