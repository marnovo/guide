# Applying at source{d}

This document describes the source{d} hiring process from the point of view of the candidate.

### Visiting our careers page

- All the open roles can be found at https://sourced.tech/company/#careers where the developer is able to apply to any desired role.

- If there isn't a role that fits but the developer is interested in working with us, they can send an email to talent@sourced.tech with their GitHub account and a small intro about themselves. 

### Screening

- Less than a week after the submission of the application the developer receives an email with feedback; however there can be delays. In any case, the developer is free to reach out to us at any moment at talent@sourced.tech.

- In the case of positive feedback in the application, the developer is asked to move to a quick Skype/Zoom/Phone call with the lead of the potential hiring team.

### Skype/Zoom/Phone call

- The developer has a quick call with the lead engineer of the team they applied to. This should be a general discussion that can last between 15-30 minutes. Its purpose is to get to know the background and experience of the developer, as well as allowing the developer to get to know source{d} better. It's expected that the developer has already done some basic research about source{d} and has specific questions about the role and/or the company to be expressed during the call. 

- There are notable exceptions to this, such as higher volume junior roles where we directly ask the developer to do the coding challenge before a call.

### Coding Challenge

- Every developer who passes the first interview should complete a coding challenge remotely.

- The coding challenge can be solved in Go/Python/JavaScript/Scala/Ruby.

- Unit tests are provided to validate the correctness of the solution.

- The time limit for solving the coding challenge is 5 hours. 

- We are expecting the solution either in a private Gist or in an attached file.

- The main point being reviewed is the correctness of the solution, however we do check the complexity and code style. 

- For the Machine Learning team, there is an additional ML task that needs to be solved in the time limit of 5 hours. 

- The results are reviewed by the engineering team and feedback is given to the developer as soon as possible. 

### On-site Interview

- Every developer who successfully solves the coding challenge is invited to the remaining interviews at our offices in Madrid. It might last a full day or be split across two half-days, depending on the availability of the developer.

- This is the last step during which it's decided if the developer will receive an offer or not. 

The interviews consist of the following:

- Kickoff with CTO, QA: to get to know the developer better.

- Design interview: to see how the developer would design a solution to a given technical problem working with several of our engineers.

- Logical thinking: to see how the developer solves an abstract problem in a logical way.

- In the case of rejection, the developer should be notified in person on the day by the lead of the corresponding team. This should be a constructive discussion giving the developer as much insight as possible. 

### Offer

- The offer is sent by our CTO through Lever. 

- The developer has no time deadline to accept/reject the offer. In cases where we have a limited # of open positions for a role, and a larger number of people we'd like to make an offer to, a time limit is given.

### Diversity and Remote

- At source{d} we believe that amazing talent should not be constrained by physical barriers. Our multinational and multicultural team shares a culture of openness and excellence and passion for programming.

- At the moment, we are 25+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid (Spain). We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely. Currently, we have remote team members in USA, Portugal, Ireland, France, Belgium, Poland, Estonia and Russia. 

- The local timezone of developers who want to work remotely should be between San Francisco and Moscow.
