# European Union Residents

Before we can make the hiring effective, our Office Manager will need to organise the issuing of two documents:
1. Social Security Number
2. NIE (Foreigner Identification Number) - European Union Certification

## Social Security Number:
You have to go to the [Social Security Office](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Calle+de+Juan+Bravo,+49,+28006+Madrid/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4228b8c1b598ef:0xbe5b5cf59fbbb5cf?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDlIWLoMvYAhVLWhQKHWfBBaoQ8gEIJTAA) (no appointment needed) and ask for a “Número de afiliado”. Usually, you have to wait around 1 hour. 
You’ll need to bring:
* [NAF Form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6AGEF9RyVDxM1NUb3k3dUxTd0E)
* ID or passport both the original and a copy

We are requesting the SSN under the passport number but we will need to change it for the NIE when we have it. Means, we have to go twice and wait twice 1 hour. 
The SSN can be requested by a third person with an authorization and the forms signed by hand and with the same signature as your passport has.


## Definitive NIE (EU Certification)
As the provisional NIE is only valid for three months, we will need to request the definitive one, the EU Certification. To get it, you have to get an appointment [here](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/index.html) first. The following options must be chosen: "Madrid" → "Aceptar", 
"CNP - Certificados UE" → "Aceptar". Then you have to add your information, NIE, name, surname, phone, email, etc. Once this is done, an appointment receipt will be issued, which needs to be printed. The appointment will be in [this other police station](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Extranjeria+Ministerio+del+Interior/@40.3929124,-3.7687487,19z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2s40.3929063,+-3.7680485999999997!3s0xd41886a34b1a3c5:0x11b380bf0104fce6!4m2!1d-3.7680486!2d40.3929063!3m4!1s0xd41886bcb2ab301:0xcb113ac8f40209ed!8m2!3d40.3930398!4d-3.7679122).<br>
