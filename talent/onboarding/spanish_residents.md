This is the fastest process. Our Office Manager will first need the following information from you:

* Full name
* National Identification Number (DNI or NIE)
* Date of birth
* Social Security Number
* Address
* Nationality
* Studies

We also need all the information regarding the job offer, which can be checked in Lever or by asking the Hiring Manager:
* Position
* Salary
* Start date

Once this information has been received, we put it together and send it to our payroll firm. 
They will then send four documents back:
* Employment contract
* Parte de alta -- A document certifying that we have told the Social Security that you have started working with us.
* IDC -- Informative document that gives you relevant information about the fiscality of your employment status.
* Huella de contrato -- A document certifying that we have told the government that you have started working with us.


Jorge has to sign two copies of the contract, one for source{d} and one for you. All of these will be saved and available on KinHR.

Every new team member will be set up on the following accounts:
* [Gmail](https://gmail.com) → name@sourced.tech or name.surname@sourced.tech (in case the first one is taken)
* [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)’s Meeting Rooms
* [Slack](https://slack.com)
* [KinHR](https://kinhr.com)
* Other tools based on each team
