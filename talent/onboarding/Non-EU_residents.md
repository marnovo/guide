# Candidates from outside of the European Union
This is the hardest process and we need the approval from the Spanish Government. We have to get the work permit and the visa in the passport. The first goal, the work permit, is the responsibility of the Company and the process must take place in Spain. The second goal, the visa in the passport, is the responsibility of the candidate and must take place in the Spanish Consulate in the country where the candidate is living. 

## Work permit
We will need the following documents:

1. From the candidate side:
    * Passport (every page)
    * CV - Resume -- in Spanish
    * Reference letters -- in Spanish
    * Diploma - Studies certificate -- in Spanish. (Sworn translation). Sometimes we need the diploma with the Haya Apostille. 

2. From the company side:
    * The same for every candidate
      - source{d} CIF.
      - Jorge’s ID
      - Strategy area - certificate. 
      - Power of attorney
      - Resident authorization 
    * Different for every candidate
      - Paloma’s authorization. 
      - Work contract- It's a draft.
      - Business activity. 
      - Project memory.
      - Job profile. 

When we have all the documents ready, the lawyer will present them to the government. The government has 20 labor days to decide if the application is good or not. The government is going to give us the “work permit” with a NIE number.  


## Visa in the passport

Depends on the country, you are going to need different docs:
  1. Filled form w/ photo - The consulate will give you. 
  2. Passport
  3. ID from the original country.
  4. Job Offer with salary indication
  5. Criminal records certificate with Apostille from every country where you have lived in the last 5 years.
  6. Work permit -- this doc is the doc which we are going to get from Spanish Government.

Usually, the Consulate needs 10 labor days. 

## Arriving to Spain

When the candidate gets the visa, he is ready to travel to Spain. When he arrives at the airport, he has to get an entry stamp in the passport. 

The lawyer will arrange an appointment with the police to save the fingerprints and be able to get the resident card. After the appointment, they need around 3 weeks to generate the resident card. The resident card is valid for two years.

To start to work, the candidates need the social security number, mean that we start to follow the same steps that we need to do with the EU residents. 

Social Security Number:
You have to go to the Social Security Office, Calle de Juan Bravo, 49 (without an appointment) and ask for “Número de afiliado”. Usually you have to wait around 1 hour. 
You will need:
  * NIE document - work permit.
  * Form NAF
  * They can ask for your ID or passport (the NIE doesn’t include photo, sometimes they need to verify your identity).

  1. Passport (every page) - Wife/husband

When the family gets the visa, they are ready to travel to Spain. When they arrive at the airport, they have to get an entry stamp in the passport. 
Usually, we manage all the visas needed at the same time.
