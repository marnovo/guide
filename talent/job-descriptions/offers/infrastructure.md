### Role 

The Infrastructure team focuses on managing and growing our bare metal computation cluster. This cluster allows us to run large scale computational algorithms and store the required information for those computations.

- Our cluster, with close to 2000 threads, more than 11TB of RAM and 1PB of storage, is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes. It has two main goals: on the one hand, it stores all the available public code in a distributed filesystem and on the other hand, it runs intensive computation jobs over the stored data on top of Spark. 

- Besides the main points above, the infrastructure team is also in charge of several other important services, such as databases, queues, CI, monitorization, loging, etc.

- At source{d}, we really care about Open Source, which is why we as the infrastructure team we contribute to projects such as Terraform & CoreOS and create our own.

- We are looking for someone with a strong Linux background, good networking knowledge, passion for automation and experience working at scale. Finally, knowledge of at least one backend/scripting language who cares about best development practices.
