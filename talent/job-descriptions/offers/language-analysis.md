### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role 

The Language Analysis team is developing source{d} tools and libraries for generating and processing universal abstract syntax trees for programming languages. These components are integrated into the [Babelfish](https://github.com/bblfsh) Open Source project, written in Go, C++, Scala, and any other language that we're parsing. 

Babelfish powers the cutting-edge research that our Machine Learning team does on their ambitious mission to provide Machine Learning on Source Code. Our tools also are being used by a community of developers, researchers, and companies across the world in order to do vanguard research and build the next generation of developer tools.

- Being passionate about programming languages is important as well as an interest in the lexing/parsing/semantic analysis of programming language's interpreters and compilers. 

- You'll be expected be experienced programming in at least two
languages and have strong good algorithmic skills. Our main language is Go, but prior experience is not a requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior experience than any specific languages. 

- Modern C++ knowledge and experience would be considered a plus.
