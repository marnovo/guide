### Role

This position is for a Lead Engineer in the Applications team.

- As a Lead Engineer, you will be expected to plan current and future work, provide mentorship and oversee the progress of the team. In general, being able to make day-to-day work smooth for everyone in the team is essential.

- In terms of coding, you will have a two-fold role: on one hand it's a Data Engineering, building production-level pipelines to collect and extract data from git repositories. On the other hand, building web applications to productionize Machine Learning research on both, backend and frontend sides.

- You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least one programming language and very good algorithmic skills. As most of the backend is written in Go with a modern JavaScript stack on the frontend, it would be valuable to have acknowledgment of these technologies. Scala coding skills and knowledge about Apache Spark aren't required but will be highly appreciated, and Python knowledge would be definitely a plus.

- A good understanding of modern development processes and technologies is required, in order to build efficient developer tools for day to day use by software engineers.

- As you will be working closely with the Machine Learning team - strong communication skills and interest in Machine Learning, data process, and visualization are more than welcome.

- You will have a major role in the hiring proces, including screening candidates, initial calls, coding challenge reviews etc.
