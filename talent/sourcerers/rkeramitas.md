    Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
        So a couple years back i was doing interail with a group friends, and we all dared ourselves at the beginning of the trip to all get green mohawks and travel Europe with them. Needless to say, it was a pretty amusing trip. At the end of it, me and my best friend were taking a BlaBla car from the french border to Paris, after a 20h long train trip from Zagreb. We were not sure how the green hair would go :p While waiting for it, some guy doing rollerblades passed by, and my friend being pretty good at it asked him if he could roll for a bit. 10 mins later his blood was on my T Shirt and his arm was broken, and thats the moment our BlaBla car decided to arrive. The drive was not fun, but the initial reaction was memorable xDD

        I dislike mangos, and that's about it aha. Don't have a favorite meal, but off the top of my head, I could eat a "Blanquette de Veau" right now 
    What is your favorite quote?
        The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart.
