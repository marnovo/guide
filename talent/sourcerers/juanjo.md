# Juanjo Álvarez Martínez

**General**
- What's your name? How do your friends call you? 
  - Juanjo
- When were you born?
  - 1977.
- Where are you from? Where have you lived?
  - I'm from Torrejón de Ardoz, living in Madrid, have lived in Valladolid and 
    Mostar.
- What languages (natural and programming ones) do you know?
  - Natural: Spanish, English (my spoken English is pretty awful), some Italian.
  - Programming, in order of competence: Python, D, Go, Nim, C, C++, Pony, Java,
    Pascal.
    I know the basic of lots of other languages. I learned to program in Basic
    (o_O) in the 80's using an Amstrad CPC 664 and a Commodore 64, then switched
    to Z80 assembly, then learned C with a badly translated version of the white
    book (arreglos y apuntadores...).
- Would like to share your Twitter, Instagram or Medium or any other social media account?
  - @juanjux

**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - Improve Babelfish but eventually I would like to do other things.
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - Maximo (we have been working together on several companies) got me
    interested in the company, then I discovered how awesomely it treats coders.
- Where will you work from?
  - Madrid, 50% office/home.
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be? 
  - D, no doubt. I like expressive languages with rich type systems and lots of features to 
    choose from when you need it. Bonus if the language is strongly and
    statically typed and compiled (Sorry, Python). Meaning that I mostly dislike Go.
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - Xiaomi or Github.

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - Many hobbies, little time:
    - Reading. I'm an avid consumer of science fiction and historic novels (past
      or future, the present is boring). I also like to read history and
      astronomy/cosmology books. And of course programming related books. In the
      past, I've also read a lot of fantasy, but nowadays I usually don't like it
      (except for Tolkien works, which I re-read every year or two years). I
      also like Roman and Greek classics (translated, unfortunately, since my
      Latin is high school level and my Greek is zero). Oh, and military history
      books. War fascinates me because it can simultaneously get the best of the
      best people and the worst of the worst turning otherwise normal people
      into heroes or monsters (usually the second).
    - History podcasts. Some great ones are "The History of Rome" by Mike Duncan
      (also "Revolutions" by the same guy), "Hardcore History" by Dan Carlin and
      I'm currently listening to "The History of Byzantium".
    - Gaming, less these days (I'm getting old maybe). I immensely enjoy the Total
      War series. I also like single player games with good stories. In the past
      I did a lot of FPS shooters online, had great stats and all that, nowadays
      only from time to time and mostly to chat with friends that are in other
      countries (so we die a lot against 15 year olds with lighting fast
      reflexes, but we don't care much).
    - These last year I've started to write every day. In the past, I've done it
      inconsistently, starting several novels and abandoning them after one
      chapter or two, but, finally, I'm doing it regularly (as in 2-4 pages every
      day) and I'm in the 10th chapter of the current one already! This also
      means I'm reading some books about literary style in Spanish and fiction
      writing in general (I have a lot to improve on this).
    - Play with my daughter, mostly doing silly things (4yo in 2018). She is
      exhausting and a little terrorist but very intelligent and funny.
    - Photography. Amateur level. I sometimes enjoy taking my camera and do photos of
      the most random stuff.
    - Collecting and using fountain pens, papers, and inks. I try to restrain
      myself on this, but it's hard. I like how almost every good fountain pen
      (which doesn't necessarily mean expensive) have a different feeling and
      "personality".
    - Coding from time to time, I also start and abandon a lot of projects or turn over maintainership of completed ones, but
      I've fun doing it.
    - Hanging with friends to have some homemade burgers and play video games.
      Another thing I do a lot less than I would like to.
    - Going to my mother village (200 inhabitants), and by night just lay down
      on the ground enjoying the total silence and the stars while thinking
      about stuff. We don't have much time to just stop and think in the modern
      world with so many distractions and noise.
- What was the last lie you told?
  - I tell a lot of lies to myself like "one turn/quest more and I'll
    go to bed (when playing)" or "just one chapter more" when reading or "I'm 
    going to jog and follow a diet this week". These kind of self-lies that you
    already knew they are lies from the start.
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - "Fuck, 7.30 already???"
- What question do you hate to answer?
  - No idea.
- What’s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - No idea.
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - Linus Torvalds or J.R.R. Tolkien but since he is dead probably Christofer
    Tolkien. 
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - I like to observe people around me but I'm usually too shy to interact
    (which makes some people think I'm asocial), except when I'm drunk. I'm
    somewhat fascinated by people (some more than others of course).
- What food do you like and dislike?
  - I like almost everything but I don't like eating babies (chochinillo,
    cordero lechal) and I dislike some green stuff like spinachs or some
    disgusting things like snails or frogs.
- What is your favorite quote?
  - "And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its
    uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he
    that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of
    things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined." which probably
    need some explanation: it's what Iluvatar (the creator god in Tolkien
    universe) tells, in the Silmarillion, to Melkor (the evil god) about the
    evil he is causing, saying that all the evils he do will ultimately make
    its world (song) more wonderful and thus better. I would like to think that
    this also applies to the small scale and that hardships ultimately make us
    better. Tolkien works are really full of subtle philosophic stuff that fly
    under most readers radar.
