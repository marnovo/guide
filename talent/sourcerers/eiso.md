# Eiso Kant

**General**
- What's your name? How do your friends call you? 
  - Eiso (sorry, no funny nicknames)
- When were you born?
  - 1990
- Where are you from? Where have you lived?
  - I am Dutch. I grew up in The Netherlands, moved to Spain, lived for shorter periods in China, Indonesia & USA, and recently moved to Lisbon where I plan to stay for the foreseeable future.
- What languages (natural and programming ones) do you know?
  - English & Dutch as a native, I can handle myself well in Spanish, a decent amount of German and now trying to learn Portuguese.
  - Over the years I've programmed for longer periods of time in Haskell, Go, Python, Ruby & PHP. I've played around with a lot more languages. These days I am mainly coding in Go and doing HackerRank style problems in Haskell.
- Would like to share your Twitter, Instagram or Medium or any other social media account?
  - I am only on Twitter ([@eisokant](twitter.com/eisokant)), I am not a big fan of social media (I like digital privacy).

**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - Keep on building a great team, help set direction and always try to be clear and open in communications.
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - I co-founded it. Today I would join source{d} because of the people and the immense passion for programming that is shared by the team.
- Where will you work from? 
  - Either remote from Lisbon or from our San Francisco office, once in a while you'll see me drop by in Madrid for our get-togethers.
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be? 
  - Haskell because I feel that the learning would never stop. 
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - I am all in on source{d} but if I had to invest in something else, it would probably be related to innovation in agriculture or education (the fundamentals of progress). 

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - I have never been a person who had a lot of hobbies. I am happiest when I have a combination of spending time with family and a few close friends, being able to work on things I love with interesting and kind-hearted people, and finding time to be healthy and exercise.
  - What you could call hobbies is that since a month I surf, started boxing again and do a lot of yoga. 
  - When I am rested I enjoy reading, when I am tired I love watching TV shows and movies.
- What was the last lie you told?
  - Honestly, can't remember
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - Is it sunny outside?
- What question do you hate to answer?
  - For those of you who know me, I am a pretty open book about myself (I can't think of any question I wouldn't answer) but I take the privacy of family and friends very serious. 
- Whatâ€™s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - I am terrible at remembering jokes but I love good humor. 
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - My younger self, I'd love to dispense some advice, all though I am not sure if younger-Eiso would listen ;).
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - I like to get out of my comfort zone, sometimes that means reading a lot about a topic I knew nothing about, in the past that has also meant, bungee jumping into a pool at 1am in the middle of a club while set on fire (there is a place in Bali, Indonesia where they allow this) or skydiving.
- What food do you like and dislike?
  - I am incredibly passionate about food, actually, that should have been listed under "hobbies". Exploring new countries/cultures through food is one of my favourite past times (I've had the privilege to patron 100s of restaurants) and so is cooking (lately I've been experimenting with barbeque).
- What is your favorite quote?
  - "Take nothing for granted"
