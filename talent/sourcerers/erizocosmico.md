**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - Well, I've been here for almost 3 years so pretty much a little bit of everything. Started doing frontend, then a lot of backend, then some frontend again at tools/platform team, then full backend at data retrieval team.
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - Project sounded cool, Open Source Fridays sounded cool and people in the team seemed cool and smart.
- Where will you work from?
  - Madrid, either from the office or from home
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be? 
  - Rust. But I'd switch jobs to something that does not involve programming because programming in Rust makes me angry and swear like a sailor.
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - Not into investments/business, so idk. If I *really really* had to invest in a company because someone was pointing at me with a gun I guess I'd just roll a dice and hope for the best.

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - Reading novels (mostly fantasy/sci-fi/crime stuff).
  - Playing TTRPGs (mostly D&D but open to anything).
  - Watching TV shows (but I'm gonna keep private the kind of tv shows I watch).
  - Reading comic books.
  - Videogames, though I rarely play, mostly because I'm a little picky with games (and suck at them).
- What was the last lie you told?
  - "Just 30 more minutes of Zelda".
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - "I wish I had churros for breakfast".

  - Anything about me (oh, the irony).
- What’s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - Can't remember one right now.
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - It would have to be something else because I don't like coffee, but I'd say Grant Morrison or Matthew Mercer.
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - I used to have blue hair just a few months before joining source{d}.
