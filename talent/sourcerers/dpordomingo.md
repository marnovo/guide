## Work

- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - I've been working at source{d} since Aug.2016; I entered in Tools team, then it was renamed
    to Platform, then it was renamed to Applications. I do front and back stuff :D
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - Before joining the company I already worked for almost 2 years with ex-sourcerers; I did not
  lose the contact with them so they could tell me the awesome things they were doing, and how they
  were working... when it was time to evolve in my career, I wanted to join the team in which they
  were working: source{d}
- Where will you work from?
  - Madrid office
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be? 
  - Go, why not?
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - TOFTS;
  - _`tl;dr`_ no idea... if you'd give me some thousand of $$$ I'd spend some time thinking on it, and I'm pretty sure I'd find a company where I'd like to invest... ;)

      - Art in general, Architecture in particular,
      - Philosophy, and discussions in general,
    - others:
