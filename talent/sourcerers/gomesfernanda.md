**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - Data Intelligence, under Product Team. I work turning the internal and external reality into actionable insights for decision-making in a variety of levels and teams; this could take the form of spreadsheets, data pipelines, software, dashboards, reports, presentations, recommendations… a.k.a. data science when closer to business than to research.
- Why did you join source{d}?
  - Super great opportunity! I was living in Brazil and studying Machine Learning when I heard source{d} needed a Data Intelligence analyst. A great job in a great company that's located in a great city.
- Where will you work from?
  - Mostly Madrid office; sometimes remote from my house, sometimes remote from Brazil.
- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be? 
  - Python.
- If you wanted to do an investment, what company would you choose?
  - No idea.

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - Anything related to music; attending concerts, listening to vinyls while having food and wine with friends, going to vinyl fairs. I love the power that music has to turn feelings into melodies, make you dance, make you cry, make you feel invincible etc.
  - Beer with friends: I'm an introvert (really, I swear), so I have few true friends. And I love bonding with them, having a laugh over stupid things or deep conversations in bars while drawing on napkins.
  - Cooking (and eating afterwards of course): I love cooking, I believe it has a strong relation to our roots, our hearts, our feelings.
  - Reading, going to museums, watching movies: activities that take my mind off my comfort zone and makes me think "WOW".
  - Lately, exercising: it's been a couple of years that I really enjoy exercising (especially running), weirdly. To feel the rush of blood, the energy, my mind becoming clearer... it's awesome.
  - Deep, philosophical, crazy conversations.
- What was the last lie you told?
  - "I have read and accept the terms and conditions"
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - "Please, cat, get out of my face" (literally)
- What question do you hate to answer?
  - Any shallow question made by someone who's not really interested in an answer.
- What’s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - Most of my favorite jokes are stupid puns in Portuguese. My favorite one is (I adapted to Spanish):
    > - "Quién eres tu?"

    > - "Soy el Paraguayo y vine aquí para matarte!"
    
    > - "Para que?"
    
    > - "Paraguayo!"
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - My father (he passed away when I was 9, he was a brilliant and beloved man).
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - I love science since I was a kid. My dad was a chemical engineer and chemistry teacher, so my house was filled with beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks, science books etc. Besides dolls, I usually got small "chemistry lab kits for kids" as Christmas gifts and I didn't care about instructions, so I ended up mixing all the substances together, making a big mess.
- What food do you like and dislike?
  - Love: PIZZA. PIZZA. [PIZZA!](https://image.ibb.co/hcqAbc/tumblr_mtszx4_P9eq1qa7judo1_500.gif) I mean, I like many dishes, but if I had to pick something to eat after spending 2 months in a space station, it would be pizza. Unless it had ginger, I hate anything with ginger.
- What is your favorite quote?
  - “A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.”
